# Flexible-memoization
A Scala memoization library whose goals are to:

- Be simple to use and to extend.
- Handle any function.
- Treat objects equality by value and content as much as possible.
- Provide built-in cache management options fetching the majority of the needs, from medium size use cases needing a versatile eviction policy to cluster wide use cases needing to scale.
